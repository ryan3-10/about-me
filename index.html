                <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
                <p class="indent">
                    I really enjoy coding. Coding is a way for me to combine my logical thinking with my creativity, which I don't get to do in many other activities. 
                    I feel very lucky to have discovered this interest of mine, although I sometimes wish I found it earlier. 
                    I hope and pray that AI does not make coding completely obsolete any time soon.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    Another one of my hobbies is playing video games. One game in particular that I really enjoy is Super Smash Bros, which my friends and I play together often.
                    I've found that video games can be pretty addicting though, so I've had to learn to limit myself in how much time I spend playing them. 
                    I still consider this a casual hobby though. 
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    Finally, I've recently taken up running as a hobby for myself. I go on 30-40 minute jogs three times a week in the morning. I've found that it helps a lot to just
                    keep my mood up, especially if I'm feeling stressed or anxious about stuff that's going on in my life.
